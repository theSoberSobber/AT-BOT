# BOT Interaction Client for AT-System
Remaining Tasks Till Completion:
- fix the update selection mechanism of the updates feature
- implement a init method for students to be able to initialize their instance until now
<br />
Problems Left to Adress: (not to be solved here)
- How to get the number of classes for percentage?
- Since we aren't doing time table, do we need a absent method too?
- current solution will be to mark everyone else absent as soon as there is atleast one present, after that everyone will remain absent until they mark present
