# BOT Interaction Client for AT-System

Remaining Tasks Till Completion:

- implement proper handling to prevent the frequent crashes
    - remove all console logs
    - wrap main.js in startBot() function and call startBot() in all catch blocks to start bot again after crashes
- implement a init method for students to be able to initialize their instance until now
- finalize AT-System API and implement it
- fetch groups from alert-bot.vercel.app/groupIds and use a for loop to send to all of them

Problems Left to Adress: (not to be solved here)

- How to get the number of classes for percentage?
- Since we aren't doing time table, do we need a absent method too?
- current solution will be to mark everyone else absent as soon as there is atleast one present, after that everyone will remain absent until they mark present
- but then how do I know that someone is talking about the same class, I'll mark everyone absent multiple times this way, won't work
